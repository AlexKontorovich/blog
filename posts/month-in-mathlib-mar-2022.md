Jireh Loreaux has pressed forward with some foundational results on the spectrum of an operator.
Von Neumann and C*-algebras may be on the horizon in mathlib soon; Scott Morrison provided two definitions of a von Neumann algebra (concrete and abstract).
There's still a long way to go before we can relate these definitions!

The coherence theorem (which we already had for monoidal categories) has been extended to bicategories, by Yuma Mizuno.
We're now investigating writing tactics which make using coherence practical in proofs.
