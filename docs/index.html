<p>When the <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/">Liquid Tensor Experiment</a> started,
in December 2020, mathlib already
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/c5009dd7140cf6ae53bf4ddeb57992eb10053b0b/src/analysis/normed_space">had</a>
a decent theory of normed spaces. With this post I want to show how mathlib can benefit
from projects like <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/">LTE</a>, showing what we added
to the theory of normed spaces in almost one year of work (this is only a small part of what has
been added to mathlib from <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/">LTE</a>, for a more
complete list, see the history of <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/commits/master/src/for_mathlib">for_mathlib</a>
folder).</p>
<p>Besides several small missing lemmas, we added the following notions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>normed_group_hom</code>: we already had the operator norm, but no bundled hom between normed
  groups. We introduced <code>normed_group_hom G H</code>, that it is itself a normed group. We also
  introduced kernels and images of a normed groups hom.</li>
<li>
<code>semi_normed_group</code>: a seminorm generalizes a norm by allowing nonzero vectors of zero
  (semi)norm. This notion is needed in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/">LTE</a>,
  and we introduced it in mathlib (providing a reasonable API). Since <code>normed_group</code> depends on
  <code>metric_space</code> that in turn depends on <code>emetric_space</code>, we had first of all introduced
  (extended) pseudo metric spaces. We also introduced <code>semi_normed_space</code> and similar related notions.</li>
<li>
<code>normed_group_quotient</code>: the theory of quotients of (semi) normed groups was completely
  missing. We now have a good API for it.</li>
<li>
<code>normed_group_hom.completion</code>: similarly to <code>normed_group_quotient</code>, mathlib did not know
  completions of normed groups. Using the already existing theory for topological groups,
  we added an API for completions of normed groups. </li>
<li>
<code>nnnorm</code>: sometimes it is useful to consider the norm as taking values in the nonnegative
  reals. We introduced the class <code>has_nnnorm</code>, with the obvious instances, and wrote an API for it.</li>
<li>
<code>SemiNormedGroup</code>: we introduced <code>SemiNormedGroup</code>, the category of semi normed groups,
  as a preadditive category with kernels and cokernels. We promoted <code>normed_group_hom.completion</code>
  to a functor, showing its universal property. Working with cokernels, an interesting problem
  arose: if <code>f : X → Y</code> is a normed groups hom, one usually consider <em>the</em> cokernel
  <code>coker(f) = Y/Im(f)</code>, with the quotient norm and it is obvious that the projection
  <code>π : Y → coker(f)</code> satisfies <code>∥π∥ ≤ 1</code>. This is often needed in computations, but
  the category theory API doesn't promise any particular model of the cokernel,
  so one can for example scale the quotient norm by any positive factor, ending up with another
  cokernel, whose natural projection has norm bigger than <code>1</code>. If <code>f</code> itself has norm less or
  equal than <code>1</code>, one can work with <code>SemiNormedGroup₁</code>, the category of seminormed groups and
  norm nonincreasing morphisms (that we proved has cokernels), but in general we ended up
  providing <code>explicit_cokernel f</code>, an explicit choice of cokernel, which has good properties with
  respect to the norm. This was enough for <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/">LTE</a>,
  but still not completely satisfying, since one cannot directly use the category theory API for
  <code>explicit_cokernel</code>.</li>

<p>This post summarizes some of the activity that happened in mathlib in October.</p>
<h3>Highlighted PRs</h3>
<ul>
<li>In algebraic geometry, there has been a surge in activity.
  After the definition of schemes entered mathlib, the development stalled for a while,
  because the Liquid Tensor Experiment took up a lot of energy and attention.
  But new contributors showed up, and are pushing the library forward.
  Two highlights this month include:<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9416">PR #9416</a> Global sections of the spectrum of a ring are isomorphic to that ring.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9861">PR #9861</a> Closed points in the prime spectrum correspond to maximal ideals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In commutative algebra:</p>
<ul>
<li>algebraic indepence and transcendence are introduced in 
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9229">PR #9229</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9377">PR #9377</a> proved
the existence of transcendence bases. 
See the <a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/030D">stacks project</a> for an informal account.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9817">PR #9817</a> and <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9834">PR #9834</a>
fills a glaring hole in the field theory library: finite fields of the same cardinality are isomorphic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In group theory:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8976">PR #8976</a> proves the Jordan Hölder theorem. It also proves a version for submodules.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9662">PR #9662</a>
proves Frattini's Argument: If $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, and $P$ is
a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $N$, then $\text{N}_G(P)*N=G$.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In number theory, <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9646">PR #9646</a> and 
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9702">PR #9702</a> prove that Liouville numbers form a dense $G_δ$ set which has measure zero.</li>
<li>In combinatorics, <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/7825">PR #7825</a> proves a
  generalized version of Hall's marriage theorem using a compactness argument.
  Using the language of category theory, there is an inverse system of solutions to the marriage problem when restricted to finite subsets of the domain,
  and <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/topology/category/Top/limits.html#nonempty_sections_of_fintype_inverse_system">the limit of this kind of inverse system is nonempty</a>.</li>
<li>In measure theory, the series of PRs <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9462">PR #9462</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9461">PR #9461</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9576">PR #9576</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9679">PR #9679</a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9680">PR #9680</a>
  prove the Vitali and Besicovitch covering theorems (with
  the optimal constant for the Besicovitch covering theorem, following 
  <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2161215">Füredi and Loeb, On the best constant for the Besicovitch covering theorem</a>).
  These theorems ensure that, from a covering of a (not necessarily measurable)
  set $s$ by nice enough sets (e.g. balls), one can extract a disjoint subfamily
  covering almost all $s$. They are instrumental in forthcoming results on
  differentiation of measures.</li>
<li>In probability:<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9323">PR #9323</a> defines probability density functions, </li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9378">PR #9378</a> proves that conditional expectation on real functions equal Radon-Nikodym derivative</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9469">PR #9469</a> brought us notations that really demonstrate we're now doing probability in mathlib!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In algebraic topology, <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9252">PR #9252</a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9141">PR #9141</a> set up some basic homotopy theory.</li>
<li>
<p>In topological algebra, some foundational parts of the perfectoid project were moved to mathlib after a long time of inactivity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9521">PR #9521</a> defines the adic topology associated to an ideal</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9589">PR #9589</a> defines the topology associated to a valuation on a ring and proves its fundamental properties. In particular a valuation on a field <code>𝕂</code> is extended to the completion of <code>𝕂</code> with respect to the valuation topology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In differential calculus, </p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9496">PR #9496</a> and <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9811">PR #9811</a> prove the divergence theorem on a box, for a Henstock-style integral and the Bochner integral respectively. This is a foundational result that will be used in complex analysis and differential topology.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9440">PR #9440</a> defines superpolynomial decay of a function</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In functional analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9540">PR #9540</a> proves the open mapping theorem for maps between affine spaces</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9924">PR #9924</a>
   states the Riesz representation theorem uniformly over $ℝ$ and $ℂ$. In
   2020, Frédéric Dupuis proved this theorem over both $ℝ$ and $ℂ$ (see <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/4379">PR
   #4379</a>),
   but, since mathlib lacked conjugate-linear maps at that time,
   the $ℂ$-version was stated in a rather awkward way.
   Conjugate-linear maps were added to mathlib <a href="posts/month-in-mathlib-sep-2021/">last month</a> and now the $ℝ$ and $ℂ$ versions of the theorem can be stated uniformly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The core version of Lean was bumped twice in the past month.
  Most of the <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/blob/master/doc/changes.md#3350c-28-october-2021">changes</a>
  are in preparation for porting mathlib to Lean 4.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9824">PR #9824</a> update to Lean-3.34.0</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9988">PR #9988</a> update to Lean-3.35.0c</li>

<p>On September 22, 2021, Carnegie Mellon University announced that a $20 million gift
from blockchain entrepreneur Charles C. Hoskinson will be used to establish the Hoskinson
Center for Formal Mathematics, housed in the Department of Philosophy.
You can read the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2021/september/hoskinson-center-for-formal-mathematics.html">university press release</a> and
watch Hoskinson's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3snIzhjqsk0&amp;ab_channel=CharlesHoskinson">YouTube announcement</a>. You can also watch
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCLJOrJFLZQ&amp;ab_channel=IOHK">Hoskinson's presentation</a> and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbz6cdnFyPc&amp;ab_channel=IOHK">my presentation</a> at an
inauguration ceremony that was held at Carnegie Mellon the day before.
The slides I used for the presentation are <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/Talks/hoskinson_inaugural.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>The center's mission is to support the work being done by the Lean community,
to promote the use of Lean and its libraries,
and to seek out ways of using the technology to make mathematics accessible and enjoyable to
as wide an audience as possible.</p>
<p>The initial endowment will be used to support postdoctoral researchers and graduate students,
as well as occasional meetings and visitors.
In the near future, the center will focus on supporting the port of mathlib to Lean 4,
developing automation and the user interface, and, perhaps most importantly,
preparing textbooks and educational materials based on Lean.</p>

<p>This post summarizes some of the activity that happened in mathlib in September.</p>
<h3>Highlighted PRs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Number fields.
  The <a href="https://github.com/lean-forward/class-number">Dedekind saga</a> continues with
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8847">PR #8847</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8701">PR #8701</a> (define number fields, rings of integers),
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8949">PR #8949</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8964">PR #8964</a>, and
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9063">PR #9063</a>,
  culminating in
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9059">PR #9059</a>
  which shows that, in the presence of an admissible absolute value, the class group of an integral closure is finite.</li>
<li>Probability theory.
  Foundations of probability theory are (finally!) coming to mathlib.
  With
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8939">PR #8939</a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8920">PR #8920</a> (conditional expectation of an indicator)
  the way was open for
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9114">PR #9114</a>
  which defines the conditional expectation of a function.</li>
<li>Algebraic closures.
  Over two years ago,
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/1297">PR #1297</a>
  was opened, showing that algebraic closures are unique (up to non-unique isomorphism).
  Due to various issues, the material was not yet in shape for inclusion in mathlib.
  Over summer, the material got a facelift, leading to
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9110">PR #9110</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9231">PR #9231</a>, and
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9376">PR #9376</a>.
  There probably are no other commits that had to wait so long before being merged into mathlib.</li>
<li>Riesz theorem on compact unit ball and finite dimension.
  Mathlib now knows the main difference between the topology of real normed
  spaces in finite and infinite dimensions: the closed unit ball in such a
  space is compact if and only if the space is finite dimensional. The
  implication from finite dimension to compactness was proved in
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/1687">PR #1687</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9147">PR #9147</a>
  proves the converse.</li>
<li>Measure theory.
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9325">PR #9325</a>
  shows that any additive Haar measure on a finite-dimensional real vector space is rescaled by a linear map through its determinant,
  and computes the measure of balls and spheres.
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9065">PR #9065</a> adds Radon-Nikodym and Lebesgue decomposition for signed measures,
  see <a href="posts/the-radon-nikodym-theorem-in-lean/">this blogpost</a> for more details.</li>
<li>Henselian local rings. 
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8986">PR #8986</a> 
  sets up the theory of Henselian rings. A ring $R$ is <em>Henselian</em> at an ideal 
  $I$ if the following conditions hold:  <ul>
<li>$I$ is contained in the Jacobson radical of $R$</li>
<li>for every polynomial $f$ over $R$, with a <em>simple</em> root $a₀$ over the
  quotient ring $R/I$, there exists a lift $a ∈ R$ of $a₀$ that is a root 
  of $f$.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Semilinear maps.
  Several people undertook a massive refactor to generalize linear maps to semilinear maps.
  This opens the door for the use of semilinear maps in functional analysis,
  but also Frobenius semilinear maps in characteristic $p &gt; 0$.
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8857">PR #8857</a> introduces notation for <code>linear_map.comp</code> and <code>linear_equiv.trans</code>
  which makes it easy to work with identity-semilinear maps (aka, linear maps) without getting distracted by the redundant semilinearity conditions.
  With this notation in place,
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9272">PR #9272</a> performs the actual redefinition of <code>linear_map</code> and <code>linear_equiv</code> to be semilinear.</li>
<li>Convexity refactor.
  Another ongoing refactor aims to massively generalize and restructure material on convex sets/functions.
  One of the gems in a long stream of PRs shows that it is now trivial to deduce concave results from their convex counterparts:
  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9356">PR #9356</a> generalizes lemmas about convexity/concavity of functions, and proves concave Jensen.</li>

<p>I have for the past two months been working on formalising the Radon-Nikodym theorem 
in Lean, and with <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9065">PR #9065</a> 
merged into mathlib, this journey seems to have finally come to an end. </p>
<p>The Radon-Nikodym theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for 
comparing two measures, and allows us (under certain conditions) to express 
one measure in terms of another.
The Radon-Nikodym theorem is an important result in measure theory and has a
wide range of applications in different fields of mathematics. Most notably, 
it can be applied in probability theory in the definition 
of the conditional expectation and in mathematical finance through the Girsanov 
theorem<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="posts/the-radon-nikodym-theorem-in-lean/#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Given two measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ on $\alpha$, we say that $\mu$ is 
<em>absolutely continuous</em> with respect to $\nu$ (and write $\mu \ll \nu$) if for all 
subsets $S$ of $\alpha$, $\nu(S) = 0$ implies $\mu(S) = 0$. Absolute continuity 
is an important notion for measures and we would like to establish a condition 
for when it is true. </p>
<p>Given a measure $\mu$ on $\alpha$ and a measurable function 
$f : \alpha \to \overline{\mathbb{R}}_{\ge 0}$, the set function 
$$S \mapsto \int_S f \text{ d} \mu$$
is also a measure on $\alpha$ and we denote this measure by $f\mu$. It is 
easy, and intuitive to see that $f\mu \ll \mu$, however, it is not clear 
whether the reverse is true. The Radon-Nikodym theorem proves the reverse 
implication for certain measures. In particular, the classical Radon-Nikodym 
theorem states that two $\sigma$-finite measures $\mu, \nu$ satisfy $\mu \ll \nu$ 
if and only if there exists a measurable function $f$ such that $\mu = f\nu$. 
This function is known as the Radon-Nikodym derivative 
(denoted by $\frac{\text{d}\mu}{\text{d}\nu}$) and is essentially unique whenever 
it exists.</p>
<p>In Lean, this is shown by <code>absolutely_continuous_iff_with_density_radon_nikodym_deriv_eq</code>
and can be found in <code>measure_theory/decomposition/radon_nikodym</code>.
While Radon-Nikodym is the main motivation, the proof of the theorem 
itself is rather simple once we have the prerequisites, and thus, the project 
spanned over multiple files, most of which can be found in <code>measure_theory/decomposition</code>.</p>
<p>Of all the prerequisites, the most important are the 
Jordan decomposition theorem and the Lebesgue decomposition theorem.
The Jordan decomposition theorem uniquely classifies signed measures and allows 
us to express every signed measure as a difference between two (mutually singular) 
positive measures. While the theorem itself follows from the signed Hahn decomposition, 
defining the structure of Jordan decompositions in Lean was tricky. While 
initially, the decomposition was defined as a proposition, thanks to the suggestions 
from the maintainers, it was decided to define the decomposition as a structure. </p>

</pre>
<p>This was important, as later on, it was discovered that we were able to 
relax some conditions on the uniqueness property of the Lebesgue decomposition 
by introducing scalar multiplication on Jordan decompositions<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="posts/the-radon-nikodym-theorem-in-lean/#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Furthermore, 
as we would often like to transport between signed measures and Jordan 
decompositions, it is easier to work with types rather than propositions since 
this required a construction of an equivalence between the two types. </p>
<p>A similar situation was reached with the Lebesgue decomposition. The Lebesgue 
decomposition states that given two $\sigma$-finite measures $\mu$ and $\nu$, 
there exists an essentially unique measurable function $f : \alpha \to \overline{\mathbb{R}}_{\ge 0}$ 
and a unique finite measure $\xi$ such that $\xi$ is mutually singular with respect 
to $\nu$ (denoted $\xi \perp \nu$) and $\mu = \xi + f\nu$.
As with the Jordan decomposition theorem, it was not clear how to represent this 
statement. In particular, it is important for us to be able to extract the aforementioned 
$f$ from the decomposition as this is the Radon-Nikodym derivative. After some
experiments, I decided to represent this condition using a class.</p>

<p>Since in order to prove the Lebesgue decomposition for $\sigma$-finite measures, 
we will first need to show it for finite measures, this definition allows us 
to reuse the same statement for both cases, avoiding duplicate code. Furthermore, 
as we would like to extract the measure and measurable function from the decomposition, 
we may define functions that choose the decomposition if it exists, and are
zero otherwise.</p>

<p>With the Lebesgue decomposition for $\sigma$-finite measures formalized, the 
Radon-Nikodym theorem follows easily by considering that the singular part of the 
Lebesgue decomposition is zero in the case that $\mu \ll \nu$.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the generalisation of the 
Radon-Nikodym theorem to signed measures follows, simply by utilising 
the Jordan decomposition and realising the Radon-Nikodym derivative of 
the signed measure is the difference of the Radon-Nikodym derivatives of 
the parts of the Jordan decomposition. However, using this definition of the 
Radon-Nikodym derivative for the signed measures poses a problem, in which 
proving any properties about them requires an absolutely continuous condition.
Thus, it was decided to generalise the Lebesgue decomposition theorem for 
signed measures from which we obtain the general Radon-Nikodym theorem.</p>
<p>Similar to the Lebesgue decomposition for the positive measures, the Lebesgue 
decomposition between a signed measure and a positive measure states that, 
given a signed measure $s$ and a $\sigma$-finite measure $\mu$, there exists 
an essentially unique measurable function $f : \alpha \to \mathbb{R}$ and a 
unique signed measure $t$, such that $t \perp \mu$ and $s = t + f\mu$.
While this version of the Lebesgue decomposition was also represented as a class, 
the statement itself was modified to be an equivalent, yet easier to work with 
statement. Namely, a signed measure $s$ has Lebesgue decomposition with respect to 
a measure $\mu$ if both parts of the Jordan decomposition of $s$ have Lebesgue 
decomposition to $\mu$.</p>

<p>By the same rationale, the singular part and the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the 
decomposition are defined similarly.</p>

<p>Using these definitions, the Lebesgue decomposition theorem was proved easily 
and thus, also the Radon-Nikodym theorem for signed measures. Most importantly, 
however, as these definition do not require an absolutely continuous condition, 
it was possible to prove that the Radon-Nikodym derivative 
$\frac{\text{d}\mu}{\text{d}\nu}$ is essentially unique without requiring 
$\mu \ll \nu$.  </p>
<p>As the Radon-Nikodym theorem is central to many concepts in probability theory, 
a brand new territory in mathlib is now available for us to explore,<br>
and with <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9065">PR #9065</a> 
merged into mathlib, a new journey seems about to begin. </p>

<p>When producing large formally verified mathematical developments that
make use of typeclasses as in mathlib, it is easy to introduce overly strong
assumptions for theorems and definitions. This paper considers the problem of
recognizing from the elaborated proof terms when typeclass assumptions
are stronger than necessary. It uses a Lean metaprogram that finds and
informs the user about possible generalizations.</p>
<p>A nice example from the paper deals with the following theorem stating that
given a ring homomorphism between two fields and a natural number $p$, one of the
fields has characteristic p if and only if the other has characteristic $p$
(including $p = 0$):</p>

<p>We see that the proof script splits the iff statement into each direction, but
both directions are proved by the same tactic block. It is non-trivial to
determine just by reading the proof given what the weakest assumptions possible

The meta-program determined these are that $K$ should be a division ring, and $L$
should be a nontrivial semiring.</p>

mathematics. </p>
<p>Rotation number is the key numerical invariant of an orientation
preserving circle homeomorphism.  Circle self-maps $f : S^1 → S^1$, 
$S^1 = ℝ/ℤ$, constitute an important class of dynamical systems. They
appear in applications, e.g., as Poincaré maps of continuous flows on
the $2$-torus.  The simplest circle self-maps are pure rotations 
$x ↦ x + a$. It turns out that any circle homeomorphism f is semiconjugate 
to a pure rotation $x ↦ x + τ(f)$. The number $τ(f)$ is called the
rotation number of $f$.</p>
<p>This paper describes the current state of an ongoing project with aim to
formalize various facts about circle dynamics in Lean. Currently, the
formalized material includes the definition and basic properties of the
translation number of a lift of a circle homeomorphism to the real line.
Yury Kudryashov also formalized a theorem by Étienne Ghys that gives a
necessary and sufficient condition for two actions of a group on the
circle by homeomorphism to be semiconjugate to each other.</p>

<p>Sébastien Gouëzel wrote a <a href="https://easychair.org/publications/preprint/sD76">paper about the Gromov-Hausdorff space</a> for the 
<a href="https://cicm-conference.org/2021/">CICM 2021</a> conference on intelligent computer
mathematics. </p>
<p>The Gromov-Hausdorff space is the space of all nonempty compact metric
spaces up to isometry. It has been introduced by Gromov, and plays now
an important role in branches of geometry and probability theory. Its
intricate nature of a space of equivalence classes of spaces gives rise
to interesting formalization questions, both from the point of view of
the interface with the rest of the library and on design choices for
definitions and proofs.</p>
<p>Section 1 gives a purely mathematical description of the
Gromov-Hausdorff space and its salient features.  Section 2 gives an
overview of the formalization. The last three sections are devoted to
specific interesting points that were raised during this formalization.
More specifically, Section 3 discusses the possible choices of
definition for the Gromov-Hausdorff space. Section 4 explains how
preexisting gaps in the mathlib library had to be filled to show that
the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is realized.  Section 5 focuses on a
particularly subtle inductive construction involved in the proof of the
completeness of the Gromov-Hausdorff space, and the shortcomings of Lean
3 that had to be circumvented to formalize it</p>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8281">PR #8281</a>, Yury
Kudryashov completed his work on continuous and smooth partitions of unity.</p>
<p>A continuous partition of unity on a topological space $X$ is a collection of continuous functions
$f_i : X → ℝ$ such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the supports of $f_i$ form a locally finite family of sets, i.e., for every point $x$ in $X$, there
  exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that all but finitely many functions $f_i$ are zero on $U$;</li>
<li>the functions $f_i$ are nonnegative;</li>
<li>the sum $\sum_i f_i(x)$ is equal to one for all $x$.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the above definition is completely standard, it is often useful to have a collection of
functions that act as a partition of unity only on some part $s$ of $X$. In that more general case,
we keep the above two conditions everywhere but ask that the sum in the last item equals one on $s$
and is less than or equal to one everywhere. This is encoded in the following Lean structure, from
<code>topology.partition_of_unity</code>.</p>
